Unlike high-level programming languages nowaday, C++ offers more hardware-friendly features. It supports pointers, CPU intrinsic functions and the ability to embed inline assembly code, among other low-level functionalities. These features make C++ more efficient than others when it comes to support new platforms or CPUs.

Moreover, C++ programs can be built with Operation System's Software Development Kit (OS SDK), allowing direct access to the OS API. That means we can enable platform-specific features, which can be leveraged to optimize performance on the target platform.
