Inherited from <span class="info-text-2">C</span>, <span class="info-text-3">C++</span> also has the <span class="info-text-1">preprocessor</span> feature, going with macros and directive commands to enable some compile-time optimizations, or manipulate some compiler flags, etc. It can help you enable or disable a piece of code at commpile-time and gain more performance. In practical, we also use macro to choose whether or not build some platform-specific code. 

On the other hand, <span class="info-text-0">meta-template programming</span> is another feature in <span class="info-text-3">C++</span> that supports flexible compile-time computation, zero-cost abstraction and much more functionalities to do compile-time programming better. Therefore, <span class="info-text-0">meta-template programming</span> is one of the most powerful feature in <span class="info-text-3">C++</span> that make it's unique in game engine development.

Hence, <span class="info-text-3">C++</span> <span class="info-text-1">preprocessor</span> and <span class="info-text-0">meta-template programming</span> are often used in modern game engines to optimize performance, extend large platform variety.
